## Subin Lim

My name is Subin Lim and my previous name was Jongwon.
I studied **High Energy Physics Experiment** in the CMS Experiment.
I graduated Hanyang University, located in Seoul, Republic of Korea.
I received **Bachelor of Science in Physics** and **Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering** for dual degrees.
I honored **Master of Science in Physics** deploma with the Best Dissertation Awards awarded by the Dean of Graduate School of Hanyang University.
I am interested in elementary particles and its interactions beyond the Standard Model.
Dark matter, Higgs boson, neutrino, and so on.
